# gebaSpike
This is a Python Package created to spike sort in-vivo electrophysiology data recorded using DaqUSB (or converted to the Tint format). This program is minimalistic and was essentially just created to speed up the time I spend sorting/cleaning spikes.

# Requirements
Since it utilizes PyQt5 as the GUI framework it should be available to a wide variety of Python versions and Operating Systems. However it was only tested on Python 3.7 with Windows 10. I do recommend using the latest version of Python as it makes it easy to download some of these C++ based dependencies.
